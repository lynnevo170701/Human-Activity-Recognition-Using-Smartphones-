1.  **R analysis script**: the main script analysis

-   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

-   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.

-   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set

-   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

-   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

2. **Tidy Data Set**: average each variable of each activity of each
    subject
3. **Code Book**: describe data set, any transformations to clean up
    the data
